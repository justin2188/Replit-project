  <img src = "Untitled-11.svg" width = "200" height = "200">
  <p style="color:purple;">The images you are looking at are a project we worked on during digital media making our own custom logo that represents us, and we are for this project i wanted it to express who I am and I achieved this by using several of my favoirte colors my initials and including certain brands like adidas that i like. I also included a line from a sports team I support in order to bring it all together</p>
 <img src = "Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 10.38.48 AM.png" width = "200" height = "200">
  <p style="color:blueviolet;">This is an image of a meme project we started at the beginning of the year and I chose to make a meme about the water of the school because around that time there was something wrong with the water and it was a big issue for the school and I wanted to create a joke about it. I overall enjoyed it, and I felt like people had to get creative to make a meme about something, and using Photoshop was also challenging.</p>

  <p style="color:green;">This image shows my favoirte project of the year the mood board I really enjoyed making a board promoting things representing me and I thought it was a great experience on canva and overall I feel like next years 9th grade would enjoy this and I thought it was very fun.</p>

  <p style="color:royalblue;">The Ai art project was really fun generating images of photos that we took I found really interesting and I loved how the Ai art created mulutiple diferent recreations of the art.</p>
  <h1>My experiences in digital media</h1>
  <p>Overall Digital media has been a really fun class I found exploring many new things like photoshop and dreamweaver very fun and to any new 9thgraders coming into ELRO i would recommend taking digital media because it is a fun class and you get to explore many new thing and you get to learn many new skills and if you have an interest in photo taking and coding i would highly recommend this course.</p>
